# FundChain

**FundChain** is a decentralized, on-chain crowdfunding platform built with smart contracts and powered by Thirdweb. This project leverages blockchain technology to provide a secure, transparent, and efficient way for individuals and organizations to raise funds for various causes, projects, or startups.

## 🚀 Features

- **Smart Contract-Based**: All transactions are securely handled through smart contracts, ensuring transparency and trustworthiness.
- **Thirdweb Integration**: Easily manage and deploy smart contracts using Thirdweb’s intuitive platform, simplifying Web3 development.
- **Decentralized**: FundChain operates on a blockchain network, eliminating the need for intermediaries and reducing transaction fees.
- **Transparency**: Contributors can track how funds are allocated and ensure they are used as promised.
- **Secure Contributions**: Funds are locked in a smart contract and can only be accessed or withdrawn under specific conditions outlined in the campaign.
- **Flexible Campaigns**: Create fundraising campaigns with customizable goals, deadlines, and rewards for backers.
- **Web3 Wallet Support**: Users can connect their Web3 wallets (e.g., MetaMask) to participate in campaigns seamlessly.

## 🌐 Technology Stack

- **Smart Contracts**: Developed using Solidity for secure and efficient on-chain functionality.
- **Thirdweb**: For simplified smart contract deployment and management.
- **Frontend**: Built with modern JavaScript frameworks, integrating Web3.js or Ethers.js for blockchain interactions.
- **Blockchain Network**: Compatible with Ethereum or other EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) chains.

## 📖 How It Works

1. **Create a Campaign**: Users can set up a fundraising campaign by specifying the goal amount, deadline, and any reward tiers for backers.
2. **Contribute Funds**: Backers can securely contribute to campaigns using their Web3 wallets, with transactions recorded on the blockchain.
3. **Withdraw Funds**: Once the campaign reaches its goal or completes successfully, funds can be withdrawn according to the rules set in the smart contract.
4. **Track Progress**: Both campaign creators and backers can track the funding progress and see the distribution of funds on the blockchain.
